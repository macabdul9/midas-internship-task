Happy new year everyone! Nice work.

One thing that you overlooked is the momentum of the rocket before and after the explosion.

A high speed rocket doesnt just abruptly stop  and explode into a sphere.

More pleasant to look would either be the rocket decellerating or the sphere of explosion also moving in the same direction as a whole.

Rest of it is very well done.  it looks like the rockets are accelerating while going up and stoping abruptly when they explode , I think it would look more natural if the rockets decelerate , slow down to almost zero and burst , and small momentum left just before blast is carried by the particles

Tldr the effect of gravity looks missing damn those fps are shit Thanks! I'll take a look see of I can slow down the rockets near the apex like you suggested. Right now it just linearly travels over time, but I guess I'll have to use a fancier math function to slow it down near the end haha. Thanks for the suggestion though! Sorry about that. just fixed it, it should perform a bit better now. Also see if you can make them follow a more realistic trajectory. They have some curve to their flight path I believe.

Still awesome though. What did you use to make this? Sure will give that try too! I wrote this in glsl, on a webgl based website called shadertoy. [Here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tt3GRN)'s the source where you can see it in full effect.",1.2,False

His book was an utopian idea of India. This is an eye-opener for idealists in society. Reality is hard. 

Hobbes said - Life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish and short. In his book:(1998)
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_2020

He talks about what could india do to become a developed country by 2020. He not only talks about technology but various other things like:
Food, Agriculture,
Health care for all,
Manufacturing,
Materials and Future, etc.
He has a lot of stats listed to backup his work.
It was written in 1998, so i think he was optimistic about things would pan out in a progressive way but with the corruption of multiple political parties across India it seems the book was just an idealistic document which saw dust in libraries.

 No matter who is in power, they will always try to propagate their own agenda and will put whole effort to retain the power. 

Regardless of all this, i still believe that Kalam atleast had a vision and solutions to the problems a developing country can face and wanted india to do much better than our current situation. Did he even said that India will be a superpower by 2020..?

As far as i can remember he talked about building  a strong and influential India by 2020 which would be a major world power. Modi is the greatest human being on the face of the planet. You liberandus are just jealous because Modiji actually does something. He has improved the loving conditions for our country. In next bill he is going to ban cancer.

You see, we were promised some 1000 Mohalla clinics, but there are less than 200 that were actually delivered. Less number of Mohalla Clinics have resulted in slowing down of programs like the universal healthcare program.

However, the fact that they managed to deliver these many while also fulfilling many of their promises is what makes them exceptional. Unfortunately, both BJP and Congress are branding their successes as their failures and although I don't expect them to lose, this time may not be 67/70. What do you guys think about Delhi getting a full state status? Hmm.. Things have been improving steady in my colony, but they also did under INC. 

I vote for AAP because I like their approach better than INC. Delhi is a complex place with multiple orgs in-charge of multiple things, eg mcd, NDMC, DJB, dda, PWD, CPWD, delhi government, central governement agencies etc. So a lot of things depend on their coordination. It's not easy to judge who is working well and who is slacking off so take any analysis here with a pinch of salt.

Anyways my summary of delhi government's work would be that they have done a lot for the poor. Here is a huge class divide here between rich and poor, legal and illegal colonies. Their policies have been in favor of the poor, very socialistic and they have certainly improved the lives of the people living in illegal colonies, the migrants and the poor. Hey haven't done muchin the already well off areas in here My parents complain about bad roads Everytime they have to go to Delhi, currently living in Gurgaon. 1. I disagree with your claim that they are losing ground support. They seem to be getting support from people who earlier didn't like them. Most people agree that they have done a lot of work and everyone hates Manoj Tiwari. Check out this Indian Express' [survey](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/response-to-politics-and-policy-delhi-voters-aap-arvind-kejriwal-6166051/). 66% strongly like Kejriwal, 24% somewhat like. More than 80% are satisfied with their work. AAP has definitely gained a lot of trust.

2. 190 were delivered till March 2019. By the end of December 2019 there were somewhere around 400 operational Mohalla Clinics. They couldn't touch the 1000 mark because of unavailability of land. And how do you feel about the media role? I think media isn't giving the Delhi govt the proper recognization ?

One thing what I have heard that govt schools are doing really well and I am very happy about that.

Thank you for your reply and have a great year ahead. Very important. See what a mess Delhi has become due to the division of responsibilities between MCD and the Delhi Government. Delhi Police isn't under the state government and it's so sad that people of Delhi can't hold their government accountable for their safety.

Both Congress and BJP have had full statehood for Delhi in their manifestos. Why is the BJP not going through with it now?

AAP‚Äôs demand is full statehood for the entire Delhi, except the NDMC area where all the government buildings and embassies are. Similar model is followed in other countries. The MCD is responsible for Delhi‚Äôs infrastructure. It‚Äôs currently being run by the BJP. 1. I'm not claiming anything. It's a personal opinion based on experience. I myself am an AAP voter.
2. Sure. But people really don't care about excuses. At the end of the day, their opponents WILL benefit from it.

The same Indian Express did another survey on a much bigger survey sample [here](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/capital-worry-pollution-delhi-assembly-elections-aam-aadmi-party-6158923/) and reported that air quality will be one of the, if not the, biggest deciding factors among Delhi voters. This is also where I believe a lot of votes will be lost to BJP and INC. As I alrready said, AAP WILL WIN DELHI, but not by 67/70 this time.",19.4,False

We have beach persons , mountain persons , introverts wanderlusts here which is the beauty of randomness.
we have so much diversity here that the collective travel experience of ours encompasses the whole of India.
 I wonder what were the odds we would find each other here?
 Speaking of odds , also think about the odd number of times the conversations here sparked joy even for a moment.
Wouldn't our life be different if we missed those moments of wholesomeness??

We influence each other's lives on a very subtle scale.

Today i would like to express my gratitude to each one of you for adding to the positivity in my life.

I am very grateful to be a part of this. Sending positive energy to all of you.

This time, I plan to apply using passport only for both identity proof and address proof. Or may be not apply at all, FUCK AADHAAR.

\- If you're a salaried employee, you will NEVER be able to claim your EPFO without doing Adhaar e-KYC.

It tastes really bitter once it mixes with alcohol. Choose food that doesn't have turmeric in it.

This is the principal reason why most attempts at pairing indian food with wine have resulted in failures. easy, get rid of the champagne and get beer I don‚Äôt Mix pahua instead Champagne doesn‚Äôt quite work with Indian food. If I had to serve champagne ‚Äî I‚Äôd serve an amouse-bouche or some cheese with the champagne.

It depends on your palate of course, but many French wines pair very well with Indian food eg Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape or C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne for reds, and many Ros√©s. [This article](https://vinepair.com/articles/indian-food-wine-pairing-guide/) has more but is not the final word on the subject. For less spicy Indian food I find even Californian Ros√©s (white Zinfandel) work well.

> The No. 1 consideration when pairing wine with spicy Indian dishes is alcohol level. ‚ÄúLow-alcohol is key,‚Äù Parr says, whereas wines with high levels of alcohol ‚Äúwill make the dish even hotter.‚Äù

> As a result, big, bold California Cabernet Sauvignons are out. Off-dry Rieslings are a good pairing but are not your only option. ‚ÄúThe residual sugar is important, but not that important,‚Äù Parr says.

> ‚ÄúRos√© works really well,‚Äù Parr says, as do easy-drinking Chenin Blancs or even spicy Gamays. He also suggests skin-contact or orange wines with Indian food. He recalls pairing a low-skin-contact Radikon with smoky, spiced chicken tikka, calling it an ‚Äúamazing‚Äù match.

> ‚ÄúPeople think that red wines don‚Äôt work with Indian food,‚Äù Parr says, ‚ÄúWell, I think they work very well.‚Äù

> He pairs a savory Loire Pineau d‚ÄôAunis with Singh‚Äôs apricot chutney-topped lamb chops, and lists light Canary Island wines like Listan Negro among his favorite foils for Indian food. I think you can safely pair turmeric based food with something dry like a Riesling or a Chardonnay This is a SG$300 champagne that I had been saving up for this occasion. > as do easy-drinking Chenin Blancs

We badly need trains which are way faster, but we're definitely better off cutting out these technology middlemen. They add no value and make projects costlier. Hyperloop doesn't even exist commercially yet in the world and I believe it will be difficult to see that happening in at least 10 years. Itn

These ""Hyperloop to connect x and y cities"" is just a hogwash. Just another way to fool the public. Hashtag jumla basically. Hyper loop is a waste of much needed resources for a country like ours. First let‚Äôs get our trains running on time. don't complain, millennials must buy there own trains We are no superpower yet, but our trains are much faster than 40 Kmph. I can sense sour grapes vibes from this twitter post. Oh my where are you....our slow local run faster than that....ü§£ Hyperloop is an absurd thing to invest in for India right now. The technology is not commercially viable right now and is not going to be for a long time. Even when the first few hyperloops show up, they are going to absurdly expensive to travel in.

Investing in improving our existing rail network to support traditional high speed trains and adding more dedicated long distance lines so that trains dont have to wait for signals too much would be much more useful. In a high population country like ours, I doubt if the hyperloop will ever be able to match the passenger capacity and cost of a normal train or HSR. What we need is dedicated tracks for passenger trains (both up and down) and two more for semi high speed trains(up and down). This is way cheaper than hyperloop and can bring the average speed to 110 for normal trains and 160-180 for priority trains. Why do we need HyperLoop again? Such a limited use case does not justify the cost IMHO. Feels bloody fast ü§™",28.6,False

You are right. However, it might be better put as the government to 56% of India's population at State level just like the BJP is a government to 100% of the population at the central level. State governments can protest laws made by the centre and in that sense, it is a representation of the 56% of India's population as the decision is not made at the individual level. 

Laws are made by the government and certainly not by the majority of the Indian people and they apply all the same. It's a way of simplifying things in an already messy landscape. wait.. that is true when speaking internationally. BJP represents 100% of India outside India because both the FM and PM are BJP plus they have a simple majority in parliament.

2. Or they knew how they wanted to retaliate / orchestrate next steps. 

3. The police can‚Äôt be trusted. Look what they did to people like Sanjiv Bhat who stood against these rakshasas.


An IPS officer who actually did his job is wasting away in jail. [deleted] Commenting for visibility. Back in 2007, one of the media houses aired the sting operation about Gujarat Genocide, called Operation Kalank. I was in its production team, and went through hours and hours of recorded footage for two days straight. That was the moment that changed my entire viewpoint towards Indian politics or in fact life as I know it. I still can't get over what I heard in those recordings. I still get nightmares visualizing what these chaps revealed. Most of it never made it past the edit table just because of the level of horridness put before camera, even though in words. But that assignment scarred me for life. 

Operation Kalank was my toughest assignment, even though I had no role in shooting the sting. But while transcribing and translating those tales, I was shivering and I thought the expose will bring about change and help serve some justice. 

We all know what happened in 2014. I left the country soon after BJP came to power. I couldn't fathom what happened in the elections and to see the party coming to power just broke me down. It's sad to see the media house never talk about that expose ever again, especially in times when it was needed. I have never shared the mental trauma of that assignment with anyone until today, but it still is one of the biggest reasons for me to not raise my kid in that country. I have never told my parents, my wife or even my best friends about it coz it's way too horrific a tale to share. Also the case was ongoing in Indian courts at that time. 

But even today, I wish to forget all that was said or believe it was all lies. But somewhere in my heart I know, that it wasn't. These men spoke unafraid, not repenting one bit of what they did. The following week, I had decided to step down and move over to another department. I believed that it could help me forget what I went through. But every time I saw some of those names, that were taken in the sting operation, on television - talk about religious harmony, condemn a terror attack - it just broke me. I can't even think of the team members who managed to get this all on tape. I can not friggin believe how they managed to get all that out of the mouths of those monsters. 

Call me weak, call me coward, call me whatever you wish to. But I wouldn't wish anyone, not even my worst enemy, to undergo something like that in their line of work. Those horrific tales will go down with me to my grave coz I believe that's the way it's supposed to be. I guess it's the right thing to do. I don't know if true or otherwise, but tales of those 36 hours will go down with me. 

I am writing this today, coz out of the blue someone on this sub brought it up. And I replied to that person about the name of the sting operation. I ain't sure if this confession is gonna help me or anyone. But it's just to let you guys know - that maybe the horror of Gujarat Genocide is much more sinister, and unfathomable. God Damn...fuck this... What was central administration doing all this while? Gujarat model Too scared to read so I will just upvote There is so much of propoganda around the riots in the aftermath of Godhra. Even here in this sub I tried to tell a few times that Godhra train burning shouldn't be the reason you butcher a specific community.
Godhra happened because of misbehaviour by karsevaks on the platform. That enraged the local muslims who then resorted to stoning the train. The coach catching fire is then hotly debated, but I am convinced it couldnt have caught from outside. But a great majority believes it was muslims who set the coach on fire.",18.1,False

Make sure they support payment through RuPay. RuPay card doesn't work on international payments. I have a UBI RuPay card but it doesn't work despite being international card. Use Master or Visa. Rupay cannot must not be relied on for international payments PERIOD. Even if you have an international mastercard or Visa, it will be next to impossible to use it internationally for most of the websites if your bank mandates 2-factor authentication. 

HDFC fortunately is a bank which doesn't have any problem with any international payments. Ask you branch to replace it with an international visa, go to netbanking and enable international tranactions an you will be able to pay. 

WARNING- On international websites, HDFC, AXIS, ICICI, etc (bank which fully support international without 2FA), payment will be completed without any OTP, password or ANYTHING. The payment will be done as soon as you enter card number, expiry, CVV. It is essential not to share card details with anyone and turn off international payments on your card once you have completed the transaction. While it is true that most payment processors don't support ""Discover"" (which powers RuPay processing internationally), check with your bank too - even if you have an ""international"" card, you have to activate it explicitly before you can use that feature. Most Indian banks just issue domestic RuPay card. You have to ask for International/Global version of RuPay card which have card number of Discover Network and fallback to it on International payment gateways. You can test your card on [stripe-payments-demo.appspot.com](https://stripe-payments-demo.appspot.com/). If you have that card then you'll see the logo of Discover in the field. Only some selected international merchants suppprt rupay, if they support it then your card will work, so its true that your card is supported for international transaction.
Visa and mastercard is accepted globally almost everywhere so i would suggest you to just request for visa or Mastercard card to your bank and it will probably cost you a issuance charge of about 500 rupees and the benefits will also be almot same if not better. RuPay is shit. More than half the merchants in India don't accept RuPay. International is out of  question. That explains it. Thanks Thanks for the reply. I think I will just go to the bank and ask them what you said.",3.1,False

It is more of people‚Äôs taste in interesting story telling than political agenda. It has started in the south from the past few years - good movies with good stories fare well irrespective of newbie movie makers / smaller budgets. Dont think so, i believe that peoples watching habits are undergoing a change. Movies with a decent script and execution are increasingly doing well, also, a lot of young people increasingly prefer Netflix to theatres. There will always be audiences thats prefer big movies on big screens but thats to be expected. While dear leader is responsible for a lot of what‚Äôs wrong today, dont think he is to blame here. Earlier there were diehard fans of Shahrukh and Salman irrespective of their religion. Movies like Ddlj, khnh,k3g, Tere Naam had teenaged girls and middle aged Aunties swooning over Sharukh and Autowallahs swooning over Salman. 

The audience's tastes have sure changed and they can no longer be satisfied by mediocre performances and half baked scripts. Come on man, just look at their choice of films these past 5 years.

1. Thugs of hindustan - seriously? Aamir khan channels his inner Johhny depp in this low grade caricature of Pirates of Caribbean.
2. Zero: Vertically challenged Shahrukh gets katrina and Anushka and pulls some Nasa shit out of nowhere
3. Fan : I wouldn't even comment on that
4. Harry met sejal: why?
5. Dabangg 3: That horse was dead long ago, the second part was itself unnecessary, the 3rd is a travesty
6. Tubelight : Only tubelights can suffer through that
7. Bharat: God that movie was a torture but still made 300 crores

The last decent movies they acted in was pk, Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Chhak de India. After that you can see their choice of films above.

On the other hand we had movies with slick editing and novel scripts like Andhadhun, Gullyboy, Padmavat, Uri, Badhai ho etc from the new crop of actors.

Now tell can we really blame the Great Dictator?

Tomorrow will you ask why we do not have another Azharuddin or Kaif or Pathan in our team and is this because of Modi too?
Bruh. From even before. The Khans started taking hits, and anti Khan campaigning started around 2012 itself.

And they make shitty movies, yes. Yes, it severely affected. It affect ShahRukh more than others because he was already on the wane. And also, SRK was the most politically vocal of all three before his 'intolerance' comment was thrashed with intolerance. 

I made this observation an year ago. People especially in Hindi heartland have a feeling these guys became stars by the blessing of Mafia and all the conspiracy stuff. Was Saaho a good movie . It did preettty good business. Saaho was advertised well and people love Prabhas cause of bahubali, and honestly Saaho was better than any of the salman khans action scenes.",3.9,False

> The panel has been set up in response to complaints filed by a faculty member who claimed that the students, during a protest, sang this poem which was anti-Hindu.

> The poem reads thus -- *""Lazim hai ke hum bhi dekhenge. Jab arz-e-Khuda ke kaabe se. Sab bhut uthwaye jayenge, Hum ahl- e-safa mardood-e-harm. Masnad pe bithaye jayenge. Sab taaj uchale jaenge. Sab takht giraye jayenge. Bas naam rahega Allah ka. Hum dekhenge.""*

> It was the last line that has turned into a bone of contention. Translated into English, it means, ***'When thrones will vanish, only Allah's name will remain'*** -- implying the misleading translation by the professor.

> ... The poem had been written by Faiz in reference to military dictator Zia-ul-Haq in 1979 and was against the military rule in Pakistan. Faiz had left leanings and was an atheist. He was known for his revolutionary writings that kept him in jail for several years.

> ... **The complaint was based on two lines of the poem, which have obviously been misinterpreted** -- ***""When all idols will be removed, only Allah's name will remain.""***

Lawyers of randia do me a solid and do a probono on this case.

Dude. You have legal rights too don't let your mom screw you over. First of all do you have enough money for food and how long will that last you?
Your mother would have paid a security deposit for the rental, find out if you can extend your stay?

I felt really anxious while reading this post. Please try contacting your grandparents. Ask them for basic assistance for atleast until you are a major.

Bangalore has a lot of locality clubs, associations etc. People there are generally civic minded, you could try approaching them in the locality where you live?

Don't be ashamed to ask for help. Are there any nice, respected people in your neighborhood?
You could may be tutor kids? Ask if someone needs a car cleaner?


But please be careful! Always be cautious of trusting anyone.

And, again, call any and all relatives - don't hesistate. This is for your survival. You are a child ffs! Dude, this sounds terrible, not to mention illegal. Try going on Twitter and DM or tweet at some prominent lawyers. Tell them your story and I'm sure someone will be willing to help you. Your mother's a total bitch, no offense. What about your dad, your grandparents?? Do you know anyone there? OP you are not alone in this definitely don't end your life because of your mom. I myself had crazy parents. 

I think you are mom is a typical narcissists from what you tell. There's a sub called r/raisedbynarcissts take a look at that. If you can get on YouTube there is a lot of videos on how to recover from abuse. 


I suggest you to study while working part time or at least till 12th std.

You can put papers in the morning and even grocery stores accept my school friends had been working like that. I think the job industry is not much regulated in India. 

Hotel industry is good but you might need to do night time work which might affect your education.

OP your very young whatever you do don't be hard on yourself. Enjoy yourself here and there have hobbies be active take up some sport.

Feel free to ask me about narcissism . I can set you up with resources. I'm 16 myself, and I don't know what to tell you, I don't know what I would do if I were in your place. I'm so shocked rn. I think completing 12th standard is important, and meanwhile, you can find many jobs (as another redditor suggests) like paper delivery, milk delivery or something like that and you can do 2-3 jobs like that in your free time (other than school hours). If you don't find any employment, it is better to contact the concerned authorities or child helpline(1098 is their phone number, don't know if it works for Bangalore or not) or something like that. I'm really scared for you man, but don't lose any hope, and try your best! Good luck! (I live in Hyderabad btw) Hey OP. How good are you with social media?

Edit: I'll assume that you haven't, and give you a lesson which you can relay to other doubters. 

The relevant lines:

Bas naam rahega Allah ka   
Jo ghayab bhi hai hazir bhi   
Jo manzar bhi hai nazir bhi   
Utthega an-al-haq ka nara   
Jo mai bhi hoon tum bhi ho   
Aur raaj karegi Khalq-e-Khuda   
Jo mai bhi hoon aur tum bhi ho   

Translation: 

Only the name of God will remain,   
That is both hidden and apparent,   
That is both seer and seen,   
The cry of ""I am Truth"" will rise,   
Which is both you and me,   
And God's creations will reign,   
Which is both you and me. 

***

This is almost exactly how some schools of Hinduism talk about the Ultimate Reality. Faiz's poetry is beyond the narrow confines of organized religion. ""Allah"" doesn't necessarily refer to the Muslim God here. It talks about the one, ultimate God. Brahman. Allah. God. All the same. The lines talk about breaking the shackles and falsehoods of organised religion, and discovering the true, all-pervading nature of God and Truth. 

So don't say random stuff before reading and understanding a work of this depth and stature. Nowhere does the ghazal ever suggest that one should ''break the shackles of organized religion''. That's a very weird way of interpreting this ghazal, and a way to Hindu-ize that which is explicitly Islamic religious imagery. 

Ghazals have a history of using Islamic imagery because they originate from Sufi tradition. 

You quote the ''relevant'' lines out of context

The stanza preceding it goes like this:

Jab arz-e-Khuda ke kaabe se

Sab but uthwae jaenge

Hum ahl-e-safa mardood-e-harm

Masnad pe bethae jaenge

Sab taaj uchale jaenge

Sab takht girae jaenge


Translation: 

From the abode of God

When idols of falsehood will be taken out,

When we- the faithful- who have been barred out of sacred places

will be seated on high cushions

When the crowns will be tossed,

When the thrones will be brought down.

This is talking about the conquest of Makkah when the faithful Muslims who were expelled just 10 years back and had to flee for their lives from Makkah lest they be killed, returned with thousands of followers to conquer the same city they were banned from, and did so without any bloodshed. The 360 false idols in Kabah were then destroyed and it was ordained as the House of Allah. The powerful establishment of the Arabian peninsula, Banu Ummaya, all their leaders then accepted Islam, and spread of Islam basically exploded after that when tribe upon tribe came and gave their Shahadah. 

This imagery is used to convey to the current rulers, that today just like you expel us and imprison us, there will come a time soon when we will be back to take your crown and our cause will reign supreme then.  

Let's look at the next para that you posted:

Bas naam rahega Allah ka

Jo ghayab bhi hai hazir bhi

Jo manzar bhi hai nazir bhi

Utthega an-al-haq ka nara

Jo mai bhi hoon tum bhi ho

Aur raaj karegi Khalq-e-Khuda

Jo mai bhi hoon aur tum bhi ho

Translation:

Only the name of God will remain,

That is both hidden and apparent,

That is both seer and seen,

The cry of ""I am Truth"" will rise,

Which is both you and me,

And God's creations will reign,

Which is both you and me. 


This stanza carries one where the last one left, and reiterates that peace is achieved after tyranny is overthrown, and invoking God's name for peace. It is basically appealing to another Islamic imagery, that of  Mansur Ibn Hallaj was the guy who was executed for saying ''I am Truth''... which Faiz interprets as a 'democratic ideal' rather than the actual Sufi belief which seeks Oneness with God. Mansur al Hallaj was executed for saying An-al-haq, the establishment is sick Basically same concept as Pavamana Mantra

Go back to the hole you crawled out of. It paves way for citizenship to illegal migrants from three countries belonging to six religions who came to India before a 2014. That makes religion as the criteria for citizenship which is against the secular nature of our constitution. The alleged purpose of the act is to give citizenship to those who are persecuted, but the bill makes no mention of the persecuted status nor does it require them to show persecution. Also, it does not include other neighbouring countries like Myanmar where Rohingya are persecuted and Sri Lanka where Hindu and Muslim Tamils are persecuted. So it is selective in nature with religion being the criteria of selection and hence problematic. CAA is a law which gives Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities of six religious groups in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. (Religous groups are Hindu, Christian, Parsi, Jain, Sikh, Buddhist)

>CAA is not asking anything of Indian nationals whether they be hindu, muslim, atheist, parsi, etc.
>Does the CAA discriminate against already established Indian  Nationals that are Muslim and if so how?

CAA doesn't discriminate directly against Indian Muslims and minorities. But one should understand CAA alone, it should be understood along woth NRC  (National Register of Citizenship).

Govt of India is planning to implement a nationwide NRC, in which every people in India will have to prove their citizenship. People who will fail to submit appropriate documents, will be labelled illegal immigrants and put into detention camps.

Now here is the catch, with the help of CAA, only Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Parsi, Jains can get citizenship easily but Muslims, Jews, etc won't be able to get their citizenship back so easily. They will have to wait for 5-11 years and that too depend on whims of govt.

When we consider the anti-muslim ideology of current govt, CAA is anti-muslim law. Which paves a way for govt to discriminate with Indian Muslims in future. I will try to explain to best of my knowledge

CAA + NRC is combined. NRC will try to take away citizenship of a lot of people who doesn't have required documents to proof of their indian origin (passport is not a proof) which is a lot of people (millions). After they loose their citizenship, people of those 6 religion included in CAA won't be affected as they would be able to get back their citizenship instantaneously but others (which current fascist government hate) will be stripped of citizenship and will be sent to detention camps.

So, CAA is not to help minorities in other countries but to strip Muslims of their citizenship. TL;DR

CAA on its own is unconstitutional. It discriminates based on the religion of the person seeking Indian citizenship. 

NRC, which requires birth certificates of one's father, mother, grandfather and grandmother will be used to strip almost all Indians of their citizenship. (Almost no one has such old papers.)
CAA will come to the rescue of all such candidates. All but Muslim candidates.

NPR is NRC in disguise.

Keep atleast 1% doubt in every news we hear from third parties. 

Keep atleast 50% doubt if the said third party is the Government. The moment you think the Army is a holy, organized and selfless patriotic entity you lose sense of what's right and wrong in geopolitics.

It's a common trait in the US where we see all foreign armies as backward and brainwashed murderers, but US Soldiers as these angelic Patriots.

The reality is, for every army, it's more often than not under educated men and sometimes conscripted men. Some are  even ex-cons given an opportunity to lower their sentence if enlisting.

If you're county is involved in a conflict with others you truly got to ask questions about why we are in conflict.

When I look at India today and some of the laws passed, I get a very uneasy feeling about where we are headed. Hey man! Welcome to the anti national club. For some reason people are willing to overlook any and all misdeeds by the army, whom they seem to consider holy. I lost a lot of respect for the Indian Army when I learnt about these atrocities. It was horrifying to know that despite so many allegations, justice was never served.

I've known these facts for years but I've never had the courage to talk about them. Thank you OP for taking the risk, and I'm glad most people here seem to agree that an apology is due. It's a shame that the government and mainstream media will never admit any of this. It's not that the everyday urban common man doesn't know about the Kashmir issue and all the alleged atrocities committed by the Indian Army but it's the Indian media narrative, since a long time, justifying each and every atrocity is what keeps our countrymen from thinking of it as anything else other than the armed forces keeping an insurgency at check. 

There's a reason why the RW ecosystem and now Modi himself calls every educated and sane critical thinking citizen of this country an anti national/ urban naxal and the likes. They know that if the young population of this country actually starts listening and understanding any of the contentious issues this country faces there will be localized uprising in every state and the govt in power can not let that happen. Instead, delegitimizing the messenger is a better way to blunt the message itself. Kashmir is an issue which is not going to be solved in a long long time no matter which side of the political spectrum you stand on. Abrogation of 370 is not going to do much to keep the local population down which is already broken. There are a million articles online by reputed journalists stating how the Kashmiri population has severe mental issues because of the continued state of oppression and general feeling of repression. The ones who left the state thrived and are the voices speaking out but the local population is more or less beaten into depression. Which is what the state hoped for when they employed the multitudes of operations you have stated. 

Every country has their skeletons and we are no different. Kashmir is a corpse which refuses to turn into a skeleton. The body stinks and the world turns a blind eye. Take what you may out of it. This is one of the more depressing things I've read in a while. This is very heavy to take in. Where and how do we even start apologizing for something like this, how do we make it up to them. Would any state be willing to be a part of India if this happened to them. I wish we would have come together at the time of Kashmir like we're doing now. No, we owe them something bigger than a apology. We owe them being treated as equal and as humans and as Indians. 

I am an army brat so have been to Kashmir and lived there. This was back in early 2000s. I was shocked by how people receive us, to them we are coming from India. No state no region just straight ""India"". They don't consider themselves part of India and why should they? What have we done there to make them feel to be a part of India ? 

Only thing we have done in J&K is not letting them be a part of Pakistan, that's it. And this video summarize the way I saw and I feel how people of Kashmir react :  https://youtu.be/Qgedqg8HmW0

All the people who are taking religion stance on it saying Hindu pandit were slaughtered and they were pushed out of their home. Aren't we doing same to people living in Kashmir and those who are living can't even go anywhere, where will they go to PoK ? Pakistan ? Afghanistan ? 

Violence breeds violence, and Kashmir is the best example of it. The torture done by armed forces is sometimes necessary evil in a war conflict area but raping of women and creating an atmosphere of terror is not. Guys you have realise kashmiri people were/are living with two forces that torture them the armed forces and terrorists. If they chose to side just the think about the things done to them by one side to make them chose the other side.

As Shashi Tharoor mentioned in his speech at Oxford about "" Britain does owe reparations"", we should acknowledge the fact the wrong was done and atrocities were done and teach our children of what happened there, instead of sugar coating it with a bill/act and saying we have successfully merged J&K with India. It‚Äôs horrifying [deleted] A simple solution would be to make members of the police and army subject to Indian law. But since it is understood that Indian law and justice is too slow and retarded to deliver and might bog down operations, police and army have been given a free hand to do what they want. There could be fast track courts set up by neutral parties but this has never been done.",32.5,False

But the slogan they are using (no God but Allah) is disrespectful to other people protesting with them. This is common sense. That's the basic tenet of Islam: monotheism What the actual fuck.. 'No God but mine' is what every religion is founded on. 

Everyone haw the right to believe that theirs is the only true God,, Likewise, Muslims have the right to believe and profess the exact same thing.

What disrespect are you talking about? 

The other protesters have the right to ignore and wholeheartedly disagree with that particular slogan while still being a part of the protest. [removed] There is a place for religious beliefs and that's not the public sphere. Certainly not in the middle of a protest to save Indian citizen's rights.  

Giving the protests a religious character is playing right into BJP's hands
and driving away those who may have supported it. The last thing you want to do is validate BJP's appeasement politics nonsense and weaken the protest. 

Finally, Muslims aren't the only ones threatened, there are tribals who are building detention centres they will be jailed in and I don't support screwing these poor people.

Middle class who are ultra religious are not going to be threatened by this act. It's the poor Muslims, like that  man who committed suicide in WB who are going to take the brunt. I don't support screwing such people's lives, just so Hijabis can score some ""woke"" points.

I get Muslims may go deeper into religion as a source of strength because of everything they have suffered these last years. But when you have inclusive slogans, why go for an exclusive one and drive more people away from the protest. ""Right  to Whole heartedy disagree""
Surely we also have the right to whole heartedly disagree when  someone slaps a meaningless label like secular islamaphobe. I'm equally opposed to Hindu religious displays at a protests for citizenship. Upper castes in Gujurat left cows to rot because Dalits finally got fed up of their shit.  Before making dumb comments look at yourself. Elaborate the issue you have. Why do you think this label is used? Islamaphobe? For people who dislike Islam. I don't like or dislike Islam.

Unless you really make a stand and fight it out, they'll insist on replacing the entire part instead of a minor part or even fixing the problem. Shouldn't insurance be covering these cases? I would like the insurance company to fight with the service center over the diagnosis since I simply lack the know-how. Good on you for being knowledgeable though. Useless upselling is becoming very common in India. The cost of useless add ons (like break cleaning, AC Vent cleaning and what not) is almost half of the necessary stuff during the routine service.

Maruti is the worse of the lot as they have so many people who are customers, because even after a decline in market share in the recent past, just about every other car sold in India is a Maruti, and they want to be able to fleece every last one of them.

The thing which I find the most annoying with Maruti however is, even after all the upselling, they place a windscreen cleaner sachet and a car perfume and charge the customer for it, even when nobody ever asks for it. Welcome to the unregulated capitalistic market. God man. I thought I just needed to learn driving to own a car. But then reading this  made me rethink. 
Do every car owners know this kind of stuff or you the exception mate? You see insurance only covers accidents, this is routine wear and year. 

Suspension isn't covered by insurance, just like wheel alignment and balancing are not. Thanks. I don't think that the damage that I had would have been covered by the Insurance. And a lot of times its not worth invoking your insurance privileges for small DIY/small shop repairs. They only end up increasing your premium for your insurance, if I am correct. And not to mention the hassle of dealing with the insurance sleuths. Insurance doesn't cover any wear and tear stuff. From my experience, post warranty/free services, every car owner should look into if he/she maybe able to service their car themselves. Mostly, its engine oil+filter change, liquid top up and general checks. The least I would recommend for every car owner to do is to source a workshop manual for your car. Finding one for a India-only-sold car may be tough, but I am sure they (hard copies) are out there. For a car being also sold internationally, its as easy as a google search. Even for the uninitiated, all you need is a few good tools, a workshop manual and a hydraulic jack and a free Sunday morning. Bye-bye dealership service stations. I don‚Äôt think every car owner knows about the ins and outs of their vehicle. Nor did I, up until a few years back. I am no way an expert but try to keep an open mind when it comes to DIYing things. If you‚Äôre interested, even if you don‚Äôt end up working on your car yourself, is to get hold of workshop manual for your car. Apart from that, there are forums, YouTube and good-ol reddit. üëç",3.7,False

But them needing your parents signature sounds like it cant be sold without their authorization so that's your upper hand.  

As others have said, definitely get a lawyer involved. It might be best to sell it and move away from them all. See if hindu undivided family law applies.. If it does it may help.. provided your family comes under the ambit. 

a lawyer could clarify these points.. remember DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING.. TIll its double checked.. EVEN the lawyers. Why can't you forgo the property and live in peace elsewhere? Just wondering. Find a job and move out with your family. Like \^ he mentioned you need to contact a lawyer. Also remember your family should not be signing anything even for a small amount.

One important thing to remember, is that even if there's a deal made by your dad and uncle with the purchaser of the property, The person purchasing the property will have to place a Public *Notice* ad for *Purchase* of *property*  to check whether if there is any claim or objection on the above *property.*

That is the time you can interrupt the deal. But it would be better if you consult a property lawyer.

Wakefit one is way too soft for my liking and is put together very shoddily. 
The Sleepx Dual has a hard side and a medium soft side, so I flip it everytime I feel like a change. And it's much better stitched than Wakefit. IIRC Wakefit too make dual mattresses. Get a spring coir mattress that's thick - I got a 8 inch spring coir mattress from GoZefo. 

It's a second hand website where they also sell unboxed stuff at a discount - my mattress was one of these.

Bought a wakefit memory foam mattress a couple of years ago, works great. Which model from them did you buy? .

>During the years 1896-1897, a bubonic plague companion made a comeback in the Pune area and began to take many lives. Knowing that the disease is contagious, the British Government has taken a precautionary measure to quarantine patients. Recognising the consequences of this, Savitribai started a hospital for the plague victims near Pune, to help the patients and their families. Savitribai also contracted the plague while serving the plague patients. She died from the plague on 10 March 1897. Role models. Thanks for the post. If he was a educationist, why is the market named after him? >When Savitribai phule started teaching, people threw dung on her on her way to school because how can she as a woman teach and how dare she think of teaching girls. 

Omg Most of the education of girls happened after independence. I believe it was in single digits before. So whatever they tried to do never worked out They truly were considering the era Their legacy extends much beyond the schools. Today, Pune University is named after Savitribai Phule. It is said that many methods she introduced in teaching are still used. Jyotiba Phule was a social reformer and a thinker who worked for the rights for lower caste and many eminent folks like Ambedkar took inspiration from him. He is known as Mahatma Phule in Maharashtra.",7.5,False

I was in the same boat as you and just decided that I will stick with my decision. Good luck Let's go step by step

1. If you have even 0.01% of doubt, YOU WON'T MAKE IT. No point reading further.
2. If you have deduced, that you came here for the wrong reasons. Well, do you have any reasons to stay and PERSEVERE? IF No. Stop it.
3. If you don't have discipline also. Your miseries are coupled, because you just narrowed your alternative options.

Now think,
You will need to work hard in any other alternative option as well, but you will need to atleast study, even if you get the right reasons to pursue.

Example in case is my friend. Studious fellow, but quit IAS preparation as he realised that he can't take shit of politicians, and went into MBBS , then did MD, Now calls shots and lives at his own terms, for how good he is at his work.

Autonomy and stability are earned with lot of hard work. But if you are determined you can achieve even in other fields in your life. But discipline is the bare minimum entry ticket to compete in this world.

I'm sincerely sorry if I sounded demotivating, but life can be brutally crashing after you realise that you wasted so many years which could have been invested in something else productive. And worse seeing your peers moving ahead... Its better to stop now than to realize that after two years of preparations. Its also better than realizing that civils is for you, but you can't make it. You can hold on to these, cheers. Even you put in the same effort to any other field you‚Äôll be better off. Did your friend went to do mbbs in his mid 20s? Yeah, he wanted to MBBS, didn't get. Did BSc, thought of going for UPSC. Taught tuitions, saved money and then got MBBS. His life was only string of miseries. I only saw him crying when he got MD.

All the ideological branches who don't see eye to eye with each other on basic issues like namaz joined together on one stage.

*New Year Motivation* Wow, I'm really having a hard time in trying to comprehend that this decade has ended!

At the very beginning of this decade, I was still a School going student who was doing his 8th grade. And in these 10 years, I have got the chance to experience milestones aplenty.

From attaining age (guess, I underwent this at the very beginning of this decade), to getting the first permanent, stable internet connection in my house (which has been a very big impact in my life - good or otherwise), in going through my 10th and 12th standards and finally but by no means the least, attending college and having had the privilege to meet and spend 4 years with my batch mates whom I feel, were the best set of people that I've personally come across, till this point in my life.

I can't believe that I've managed to go past all these experiences. And again, I really can't believe that this has all happened in a span of 10 years when at best, it feels more like as if only 5-7 years have passed. Guess, it probably was college that makes me feel this way and thus, it was like a bullet train ride for me, of sorts (as I got to cover a lot of distance/ gain XP, all in a fairly short period of time).

I suppose, from this decade onwards, I'll get/have to live my life as an adult, as a ""grown-up"" (which honestly, I don't want to). And yet, for some reasons, I couldn't help but get this feeling that my life (and myself really) peaked in this decade and that despite all the hardships, trauma and times of turbulence that I had to undergo and have a hard time letting it go by, I still get an impression that it'll be hard to top this decade of for me and that, I was in my prime, my absolute best.

Let's hope that it doesn't end up being the case. For I feel that I have just started my life. And I am yet to live life in my own terms, find the person whom I could call as my SO etc..... 

I wish to thank everyone here for being with me in times when I was in my lowest and vulnerable. Somehow, I'll surely make it up to all those who have been benevolent and kind to me.

And I wish you all the very best for a new year and to lead a good, wholesome life that'll have everyone of us here reach our goals and desires and makes us feel content and at peace.

""Thanks for the adventure. Now, go have a new one."" The whole day I was irritated and frustrated over little things. There's a lot going on in my mind and I'm not overthinking for sure. It's just the things which matter to me are annoying me because I don't feel like I'm worthy enough. 

I hope your day was full of warmth and happiness. Lots of love! 2 exams aur bas. Phir mein aaram se soungi. Don't make long term resolutions you can't keep.
Make short term goals and complete it before moving to the next.

First baby steps.
Then giant leaps.

Chronology samajh lijiye.

Dream big. Stay motivated.

Joi Aai Axom! I don't understand half the comments on this thread and that's honestly hilarious. Do you guys do this every day? First full time job's paycheck to kick off the decade .. can only pray this one is as fulfilling as the past one was arduous. ‡§•‡•ã‡•ú‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§•‡•ã‡•ú‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡•õ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∞‡§§ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ [deleted] saal shuru karte he trains ka kiraya badha diya.

If you don't want to approach the police yet and not involve your parents into this. I would suggest , if it's a less amount, pay it and get rid of him. 
If he tries to blackmail you even after that, then you will have to take it to the Police.
Make sure you record the calls, as a proof. Try getting legal help because
There will be no end to blackmailing.
Try reaching out to senior police officers via personal appointment or social media. They will help. Mostly a stern warning from them will deter the blackmailer.
And lastly be cool. If you haven't done anything wrong . You will be fine. If this India, you should able to get away with anything in a court of law however bad it is.

The video is just me and my female friend outside the bathroom (both men's and women's are in the same area), them accusing us of being in the women's bathroom, and one of them hitting me. Both our faces are visible in the video.

Should I pay him and then go to the Police if it persists? Or should I straight up go to the police? There was a crowd of administration/guards outside the bathroom. This guy who has my number showed up later. I don't know who he is.

Understand your interests first. Building your own or joining a start-up is an amazing thought, but you must identify your role in that organization and work towards that. Develop skills required for that role while you study for your bachelor's.

Tbh, there are ample opportunities available for engineers especially in fields of DS and ML, thing is you should know where to look. From hackaton to research opportunities for undergrads. Search for professor's research background of the institute you decide to join. Check if you find research papers in field you want to pursue and try to contact the faculty researching that field. Try and contribute to their projects. Take a year off and explore. There's no substitute to that. In case you don't wanna go for another attempt, Get into NITs and explore the world.

I'm trying to learn more and more about it, and as I learn, i find out how these leaders have molded the constitution for their own benefit.

You said some were rolled back in next government, however I noticed, 

24 th amendment, in which Article 13 and 368 were changed dated 05.10.1971, were never actually rolled back.
Wikipedia:
Amendment passed during internal emergency by Indira Gandhi. Provides for curtailment of fundamental rights, imposes¬†fundamental duties¬†and changes to the basic structure of the constitution by making India a ""Socialist Secular"" Republic.

This directly affect the fundamental duties and Basic structure, I'm confused, if it's fundamental and it was somehow changed, why it was left out if many other amendments were rolled back? SC has given explantion for upholding 24th amendment in Kesavanada Bharati case as far as I remember. Further parliamentary amendments are subject to judicial review, which is part of Basic structure n hence acts as a check on amendments. So art 368 is basically in check with article 13. So it can be considered as a case of two doctrines - progressive interpretation and its check, doctrine of severability. I believe the judicial review was discussed in length during right to privacy SC hearing as part of Aadhar. If you're really interested in understanding how amendments were used by the government to suit political needs please read this book by Granville Austin - Working in a Democratic Constitution: A History of the Indian Experience.
This book looks at the history and politics of constitutional reform in Post colonial India from 1950-1980.

The object of this Bill is to ostensibly to provide for religiously persecuted persons from neighbouring countries, who want to seek citizenship in India.

What if western countries start deporting illegal immigrants back to India like India wants to with Bangladesh, worse yet what if Muslim majority countries start sending back Hindu economic migrants in their lands on the basis of the actions of the Indian government towards Muslims?

This government is doing a good job of radicalizing the diaspora and there have been various arrests in Saudi and UAE of Indian migrants being detained for expressing violent views towards Muslims. 

I wonder if the long term effects of changing India‚Äôs immigration and citizenship laws was taken into account before all these actions were implemented. India wants a treaty where fugitives can also be deported even if they are legal. India is using it as a negotiation tactic. They don't think. At all. Well, it seems deportation doesn't seem to be high up on the list of priorities. According to India's official reply to Bangladesh on the issue, NRC was an ""internal matter"" until at least October.

(Brings about the soulmate factor where she is the only one that could drag him out of his player ways, also how he changed as he grew older and his priorities became different).It also shows us how unaffected he was by say, Deepa‚Äôs love for him, as compared to Shalini‚Äôs love for him, making it all the more dramatic. This one sided love thing is overused by Bollywood. Still making it a huge deal with Aae Dil Hain Mushkil. Dil Chahta Hai being a very excellent movie, I feel it should have had some more humor. Wow that's a nice take on it. At the same time, I think, it also has something to do with Sid. You see, Sid was the practical one. And while he tells Deepa to let go of Aakash, he couldn't get himself to let go of Tara. Yes it has all to do with Aakash, but maybe, the director wanted to bring out the irony and helplessness here. I don't know. I'm really over analytical. Agreed but I have to admit, I don't mind the over using. And sex scenes

/s I completely agree with the Sid and Tara comparison with the Deepa and Aakash comparison. Later on in the movie though, we do see Sidhart stick by his own advice? He never pressed Tara to pursue the relationship, in-fact she got to about it through stumbling in on the conversation between Sidhart and his mom. He never ‚Äògrasped the sand‚Äô too tight, for he knew Tara would escape at the first possible chance. He enjoyed his time with her, and made the most of it without romanticising it. Yes, Let's have remake of this movie, directed by Anurag Kashyap, release on Netflix.

There are cases in Bangladesh and Pakistan where minorities(hindus) are threatened with false cases and extortions etc. A comment about multiple gods by hindu could also be treated blasphemous by their law. India will and should provide amnesty for such persons. But that doesn‚Äôt make it less contentious in any way. As far as Courts are concerned if they can start proceedings in the night to reverse the judgement of hang till death for terrorists because it is a human rights violation, they surely could have sit through a winter break to stop it or at least could have put a stay on it. Yaar ye joke kuch zyada kheech gaya So your argument is that just because these countries treat their minorities wrongly we should do the same? Change principles of constitution? We should become Pakistan because Pakistan is doing the same to their minorities?

This bill DOES NOT apply to people here on work permits. Work permits are not proof of citizenship and workers, especially agricultural labourers and daily wage workers, cross the border daily.

How will this creating be different?

""  in different preparations and ways of cooking. "" : What are some example of these different preperations and the what the differant ways of cooking, how are these different from the traditional way of making vegan food? It's by using references of peer reviewed studies mentioned and using information highlighted by  Dr Michael Greger , and other well researched vegan dietitians which have helped in understanding the impact of different foods on health , what are the benefits of a vegan diet vs lacto vegetarian and non vegetarian diet. The importance of leafy green veggies , vegetables, fruits , eating as much whole grain foods and whole foods as possible with minimum processing of food to maintain the nutritional value of it.

Many ways to prepare vegetables , boil, sauce, steam , blanch ... why I specifically mention different way of cooking is because the traditional way of making indian food involves boiling almost everything in the form of a curry or oily salted vegetables (high heat saute) with plenty of spices and condiments which defeats the purpose of eating vegetables as the antioxidants and vitamins have been completely removed by high heat cooking. I like the questions you asked, thanks for asking ! I'm looking for people interested so ultimately I can create a menu of vegan items and make it into a healthy food cafe. One of it's kind. But you haven't really answered any of my questions. Everyone already knows benefits of eating fruits and vegetables, it has been researched extentesively by scientists across the world. And the methods of cooking you have mentioned are nothing new either. 

What is unique to what you are trying to do? Whats the novelty?.

Can you give example of just one dish you want to make? an example recipe which a new way to make this vegan dish? At least in theory you should one exmample dish right? What is it? I understand what you mean , it's not new in terms of making vegan food in itself or simply eating more plant based foods .. it's more about the collection of food dishes and recipes which caters to the kind of people who're used to eating traditional indian food ... Its already known that eating vegetables and fruits is healthy and better for health but how many people actually eat more veggies , almost none. It's by making good tasting plant based food that I want to attract people to this lifestyle. 

The Novelty here is to make all kinds of food without animal derived food products , completely plant based... India is not yet on the map when it comes to vegan food alternatives , neither is it as easy to make vegan food regularly because vegan cheese, vegan butter , nut milks have to be made from scratch as one cant simply go to the supermarket and buy these things except for the super expensive options in imported food markets.

I want to simply share thoughts and ideas with someone who also likes cooking , it's not about logistics or a grand plan for me right now .. I just want to learn as much as I can about making vegan food.",0.3,False

I have everything going for me, yet, the only time I saw my parents happy was when I got engaged Against my will. Now that I broke it, they‚Äôre back to guilt tripping me again. I think I‚Äôm not too wrong when I speak for everyone, parents are only happy when you are happy according to how they define it. No matter what, we don‚Äôt stop loving them right? Give some of that love to yourself. There‚Äôs more to a persons definition than their family/career/sexuality/relationship status. Pursue a hobby, volunteer and help people out, get professional help if you can. Chin up, fighter ‚ù§Ô∏è I have one solution which actually worked for me so I am letting you know..Just leave the home and go to some quiet place where no one knows you.. Probably some place cool..live there for days..I was in Shimla for almost six months when I ran away from home..

It helps you clear your mind and having unknown people around you create a new start, unknown people don't judge you for what you're not... of course they judge you for what you are..so tell them some interesting story about who you are..I told people in Shimla that I am son of SP in Mumbai but ran away because my dad wanted to join me police Force..lol that was stupid but it worked..

I went back to home after six months those six months were best days of my life. Now I am married, got kids and all I wish I could do that again. My friend brought this post to my attention because he said I would relate to it. I read it and for a second I thought, ""Wait, did I write this?"". I cannot say I understand all of what you're going through. 

I'm almost 22 but I'm still in the closet. However, I know that if I were to come out things will never be the same, instead everything will only become worse. But I completely understand the sense of loneliness and lack of self-worth and the craving for the sweet release of death, I feel it too. I have been struggling with this problem since I turned 15 (wow... 7 long years). I thought that moving abroad to start a new life would make things better but it only made me feel more isolated. They say that it's easier to get professional help in the US without that much of a stigma, but they never tell you that there are just so many people who also need help that the line is long, too long. 

For your sake, and mine, and all those people out there who are going through similar problems, I hope that we are able to power through. I'm here to talk, if you want. Sometimes, just knowing that you're not alone in this can help‚Äî I know it does for me. And our situations seem quite similar, so if you ever want to have a pity party, I'm here to listen. Dear boy, I m so sorry for your state of affairs.

I swear indian parents just don't want their children to be happy. They want their children to live they way they couldn't. 

You are not alone in this journey. There are many many people who don't get to find someone because they're from a different religion or caste. They age and finally its gets hard for them to find someone. 

There are many many obstacles to finding someone to marry in india and this is after the girl/boy likes each other. 

you have brought a new challenge by being gay. There is nothing wrong being gay. Tell them the CEO of one the most valued company APPLE is gay. If they can't accept it(most probably not), they will have to find a way to live with it. 

Why do parents dictate sexuality ? Because they are afraid of society and what other people will think. 

Sadly , we live in the one the most regressive parts of the world. only the future generation can change it and you are part of that generation. if you give up , then what hope is there for change in the future. Our generation is the bridge between old and new and we must make the sacrifices so that the future can change. 

I hope you find all the strength and courage in the ordeal. But do not worry as we are with you. After seeing the protest by youth. I have hope for first time and in time you shall also find that hope. There's some advice good and bad in the comments here, and I don't know how much I can add that will be helpful. I only want you to know that it will get better, that you are not alone, and none of the seemingly perfect people are as put-together as one might imagine. I'm sorry that marriage is the be-all and end-all of so many social expectations, so that any difference in sexuality gets viewed as a betrayal rather than something that is profoundly natural and profoundly human. In addition, I want you to know that I'm sorry that we're in a society that has people who create unswervingly stringent expectations of how things turn out, so that so many of us live lives wracked with guilt. However, this is slowly changing, and will continue to change for the better.

In the meantime, in case it's some comfort, in case it's an escape, might I suggest looking up the narratives of other people, either out or in the closet that might provide a sense of companionship and belonging to a wider community? I hope you will forgive this random assortment of things. It seems to contain older British men--I think the reason is that they went through about 30-50 years ago what our society is going through now:

Well, some of what you have thought and felt has been been felt by others. And I know that reading or listening to these things will not untangle the knot of your life, but I wanted, if possible, to give you some courage. Take care, unknown brother! Fuck. Don't do anything rash man. Please!!! üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüòî  

My dude.

It's going to be okay. You're going to be okay. I get your feelings of helplessness and being set adrift, I've been there. But it gets better.

That said, mere platitudes like that aren't and shouldn't be enough to get you healthy and happy again. You're not superhuman and no one expects you to be. Talk to a professional who will help you get through what you're feeling right now. If you're in Mumbai, contact the Saahas therapy group on Instagram (@saahastherapygroup) and they'll be happy to have you, for free, no (undue) questions asked. If you're not in Mumbai, contact them anyway and they should be able to put you in touch with therapists who can help you get to where you need to be to figure this out.

Good luck. We're rooting for you. I don‚Äôt know you or your pain, your true situation, your parents, or any mile stones in your life. I‚Äôm 30 as well and it killed me reading every word because you have a terrible lens blocking you from the rest of your life. I‚Äôm not a therapist and I wish I was someone who could get a beer with you and talk. Please try and get professional help. Most everything you said sounds like a chemical imbalance, and getting help can help get you in a better place. I wish I had words for you to fix everything, but it needs to start with you reaching out to the right avenues. You still have most of your life in front of you. Don‚Äôt stop trying. Hang in there, OP. It may not matter to you, but this mattered to me. You‚Äôre not alone in this world, theres millions like you. Take care, OP Remember, you laughed with your parent and gonna leave them with a guilt with rest of their life thinking it was their mistake. (Not fair man)

Remember, people who encouraged you will miss you for rest of their because they saw some potential in you which you haven‚Äôt yet. ( let‚Äôs find out then)

Overthinking will give you several other choices too. Please choose wisely and death shouldn‚Äôt be an option. You‚Äôre 30 and just 30. Your life might change tomorrow and this post will make you chuckle. Just like how you cried over something when you were a child.. now it‚Äôs good, old, sad memory. Something‚Äôs fades too. Hope this will to. 

Don‚Äôt make choices that are unnecessary to life now. We‚Äôre mortal and we will die when the time comes which will happen naturally and shouldn‚Äôt be manual. 

Please ask for help. I‚Äôll dm you the list of doctors who can help. Don‚Äôt hesitate. It‚Äôs costs nothing compared to your life. Trust me, life is precious.

Quick disclaimer, that a lot of the flags in here are not officially used flags but have mere representative function.
For example, Bijampur did not use this kind of flag but the green color pattern was most likely more than present in the state as it was a Shia ruled state at the time.
The various flags in the really small nations in Nepal are fictive and based off some other local places flags. Tibet enjoyed a fair share of Buddhist religious flags for smaller states.
EU4 flags were used in some places but avoided where I could like in Ayutthaya where the elephant seal was not in use on the official flag.
